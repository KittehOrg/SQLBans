# SQLBans #

SQLBans intends to be a simple solution to the lack of a quality, fully configurable, easy to use banning plugin utilizing MySQL to enable multiple servers in one gaming network to operate on a single, shared bans list.

This is not a global banning system, this is a local banning system for server admins running multiple servers.

SQLBans is fairly lightweight and efficient.
